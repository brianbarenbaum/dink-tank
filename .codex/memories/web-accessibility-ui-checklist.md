# Web Accessibility & UI Checklist

## Applies when
- Any visible UI changes
- Forms, navigation, interactive controls, modals, and dialogs

## Required checks
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA for text and key UI states.
- Inputs, buttons, and links have accessible names and visible focus states.
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive controls.
- Error/validation messages are visible, specific, and associated with fields.
- Semantic landmarks/headings are used in page-level layouts.
- Motion and auto-updating UI avoid accessibility regressions.

## Responsive checks
- Verify at least one mobile and one desktop viewport.
- Confirm no clipped text, overlapping controls, or off-screen dialogs.
